LiAirCell_Humidity Control
===
Software for a humidity controlled gas flow for Li-Air Cell testing.  This is intended to be used for a Swagelok-type cell.

A pure O<sub>2</sub> stream is split between two mass-flow controllers (MFCs) and one of the streams is humidified. These are recombined to produce a gas stream of desired humidity.  The output humidity is measured and the flow through each MFC is regulated by closed-loop feedback:
